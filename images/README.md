# Instructions for Using Images

You can access images hosted on GitHub using the following URL format:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repository>/<branch>/<path-to-image>
```

Replace `<username>` with `bennyboy54001`, `<repository>` with `Vrchat-world-whitelist`, `<branch>` with the branch name (usually `main`), and `<path-to-image>` with the path to the image file in the repository.

For example:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bennyboy54001/Vrchat-world-whitelist/main/images/image.png
```

This URL will provide direct access to your image file.
